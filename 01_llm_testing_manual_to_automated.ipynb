        "\n",
        "  **Why parameterize?**\n",
        "  - Testing one port proves nothing about the LLM's broader knowledge\n",

        "1. **Write clear, specific prompts** - Reduces ambiguity\n",
        "2. **Test one thing at a time** - Easier to debug failures\n",
        "3. **Use descriptive test names** - `test_ticket_severity()` not `test_1()`\n",
        "4. **Add helpful assertion messages** - Explain what you expected\n",
        "5. **Test edge cases** - Empty inputs, very long inputs, ambiguous cases\n",
        "6. **Use Pydantic for structured outputs** - Automatic validation\n",
        "7. **Group related tests** - Use separate test files for different features\n",
        "8. **Check for key concepts, not exact strings** - LLMs may phrase answers differently\n",

        "### ❌ DON'T:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Don't expect exact string matches** - LLMs vary in phrasing\n",
        "2. **Don't test creative tasks too strictly** - Allow for variation\n",
        "3. **Don't ignore flaky tests** - Investigate and fix them\n",
        "4. **Don't test too many things in one test** - Keep tests focused\n",
        "5. **Don't forget to test error cases** - What if API fails?\n",

        "3. **Error cases** - Invalid inputs\n",
        "4. **Consistency** - Check for key concepts across multiple runs\n",
