        "\n",
        "In production, you often need to test systematically across many scenarios using batch evaluation. It has several benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "  1. üßê Comprehensive Coverage\n",
        "\n",
        "  Instead of manually testing a few happy-path cases, you can\n",
        "  create **test suites** covering low-income customers, elderly users, people\n",
        "  experiencing financial hardship, and other vulnerable populations. This\n",
        "  comprehensive approach helps you identify patterns like \"Agent fails on 80%\n",
        "  of vulnerable customer scenarios\" that would be invisible with spot-checking.\n",
        "   You'll also discover edge cases and unexpected failure modes that manual\n",
        "  testing would miss.\n",
        "\n",
        "  2. üßê Statistical Confidence\n",
        "\n",
        "  A single good response doesn't prove your agent is reliable or safe. To have\n",
        "  real confidence in your agent's behavior, you need **statistical evidence\n",
        "  across many scenarios**. Running batch evaluations gives you meaningful\n",
        "  metrics: a 95% pass rate across 100 tests tells you something definitive\n",
        "  about your agent's quality. You can track concrete numbers like \"Overall\n",
        "  ethical pass rate: 87%\" and make data-driven decisions about whether your\n",
        "  agent is ready for production.\n",
        "\n",
        "  3. üßê Automated Regression Testing\n",
        "\n",
        "  Batch evaluation becomes your regression test suite. **Every time you modify\n",
        "  your agent's prompt or system instructions, run the same batch to see if\n",
        "  quality improved or degraded**. This automated approach lets you quantify the\n",
        "  impact of changes with statements like \"New prompt reduced appropriateness\n",
        "  failures from 15% to 3%.\" Without batch testing, you're making changes\n",
        "  blindly, hoping they improve things without breaking what already works.\n",
        "\n",
        "  4. üßê Systematic Failure Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "  When you evaluate in batches, patterns emerge. You can analyze **which\n",
        "  scenarios fail most frequently**, **which ethical dimensions are consistently\n",
        "  weak** (transparency, pressure tactics, privacy respect), and **where your agent needs the most improvement**.\n",
        "\n",
        "  5. üßê Production Readiness\n",
        "\n",
        "  Batch evaluation **simulates the real-world diversity your agent will encounter in production**. It validates that your agent behaves appropriately across different customer types, situations, and queries before you deploy.\n",
        "  Additionally, batch evaluation results provide an **audit trail for compliance\n",
        "  purposes** which is critical in regulated industries like banking where you need to demonstrate due diligence in testing your systems.\n",

        "\n",
        "#### 1. **Provide Clear, Specific Criteria**\n",
        "\n",
        "‚ùå **Vague:** \"Is this response good?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "‚úÖ **Clear:** \"Does this response provide actionable steps the user can follow immediately?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. **Use Multiple Test Cases**\n",
        "\n",
        "Don't rely on a single judgment. Batch evaluation gives you:\n",
        "- Statistical confidence\n",
        "- Pattern detection\n",
        "- Overall quality trends\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. **Consider Multiple Judge Runs for Critical Decisions**\n",
        "\n",
        "For high-stakes evaluations:\n",
        "- Run judge 3-5 times\n",
        "- Take average or median score\n",
        "- Flag cases with high variance\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 4. **Combine with Assertion Tests**\n",
        "\n",
        "Use both approaches:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Assertion test: Check for required information\n",
        "assert 'account number' in response.lower()\n",
        "\n",
        "# Judge test: Check quality\n",
        "eval = llm_judge(response, \"clarity\")\n",
        "assert eval.score >= 3\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 5. **Set Reasonable Thresholds**\n",
        "\n",
        "Don't require perfect scores:\n",
        "- ‚úÖ Threshold = 3+ (acceptable quality)\n",
        "- ‚ö†Ô∏è Threshold = 5 (too strict, will have false negatives)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6. **Monitor Judge Performance**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Track judge scores over time\n",
        "- Expect some inconsistency\n",
        "- Use multiple runs for critical decisions\n",
        "- Look for drift or inconsistency\n",
        "- Update judge prompts as needed\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 7. **Use Structured Outputs**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Always use Pydantic models\n",
        "- Always request JSON output in prompts: \"Return ONLY valid JSON, no other text\"\n",
        "- Always validate and handle errors\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 8. **Document Your Criteria**\n",
        "\n",
        "Keep track of:\n",
