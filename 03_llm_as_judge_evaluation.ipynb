    "## 📚 Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify when assertion-based testing isn't sufficient\n",
    "2. Build an LLM-as-judge evaluation system\n",
    "3. Create single-dimension and multi-dimension evaluations\n",
    "4. Use Pydantic for structured judge outputs\n",
    "5. Evaluate banking agent responses for ethical behavior\n",
    "6. Run batch evaluations and analyze results\n",
    "7. Understand judge reliability and best practices\n",

    "## 🎯 Context: Why LLM-as-Judge?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quick Recap: What You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook 01:** Pytest for LLM testing\n",
    "- ✅ Test factual correctness: \"Does LLM know SSH uses port 22?\"\n",
    "- ✅ Test structured outputs with Pydantic\n",
    "- ✅ Parameterized tests for multiple scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notebook 02:** Testing ADK agents\n",
    "- ✅ Test tool selection: \"Did agent call the right tool?\"\n",
    "- ✅ Test parameter extraction: \"Did agent extract correct ticket ID?\"\n",
    "- ✅ Test multi-step reasoning: \"Did agent follow logical sequence?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem: When Assertions Aren't Enough\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assertion-based testing is GREAT for:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Objective, verifiable facts\n",
    "assert \"22\" in response  # SSH port\n",
    "assert ticket_id == \"5678\"  # Correct extraction\n",
    "assert 'lookup_ticket' in tool_calls  # Right tool\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**But what about these questions?**\n",
    "- ❓ Is this banking advice **helpful** to the customer?\n",
    "- ❓ Is the explanation **clear** for a non-technical user?\n",
    "- ❓ Is the tone **professional** and empathetic?\n",
    "- ❓ Does the agent avoid **unethical** sales pressure?\n",
    "- ❓ Is the response **appropriate** for the customer's situation?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are **subjective qualities** - hard to test with simple assertions!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution: LLM-as-Judge\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idea:** Use another LLM to evaluate the quality of the first LLM's output!\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Banking Agent LLM → Response → Judge LLM → Score & Reasoning\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Judge evaluates:**\n",
    "- Helpfulness (1-5)\n",
    "- Clarity (1-5)\n",
    "- Professionalism (1-5)\n",
    "- Ethical behavior (1-5)\n",
    "- + Reasoning for each score\n",
    "\n",
    "### Today's Focus: Banking Ethics\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build a **Banking Customer Service Agent** and use LLM-as-judge to detect:\n",
    "\n",
    "🚫 **Unethical behavior:**\n",
    "- Pushing products customers don't need\n",
    "- Recommending risky investments to vulnerable customers\n",
    "- Using high-pressure sales tactics\n",
    "- Asking unnecessarily sensitive questions\n",
    "- Exploiting customer vulnerabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Ethical behavior:**\n",
    "- Recommending suitable products based on needs\n",
    "- Clear, transparent information\n",
    "- Respectful of privacy and boundaries\n",
    "- Empathetic without being intrusive\n",
    "- Balanced, unbiased advice\n",

    "### Best Practices for Reliable Judging\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Provide Clear, Specific Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Vague:** \"Is this response good?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Clear:** \"Does this response provide actionable steps the user can follow immediately?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Use Multiple Test Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't rely on a single judgment. Batch evaluation gives you:\n",
    "- Statistical confidence\n",
    "- Pattern detection\n",
    "- Overall quality trends\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Consider Multiple Judge Runs for Critical Decisions**\n",
    "\n",
    "For high-stakes evaluations:\n",
    "- Run judge 3-5 times\n",
    "- Take average or median score\n",
    "- Flag cases with high variance\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Combine with Assertion Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "Use both approaches:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Assertion test: Check for required information\n",
    "assert 'account number' in response.lower()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Judge test: Check quality\n",
    "eval = llm_judge(response, \"clarity\")\n",
    "assert eval.score >= 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Set Reasonable Thresholds**\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't require perfect scores:\n",
    "- ✅ Threshold = 3+ (acceptable quality)\n",
    "- ⚠️ Threshold = 5 (too strict, will have false negatives)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Monitor Judge Performance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Track judge scores over time\n",
    "- Look for drift or inconsistency\n",
    "- Update judge prompts as needed\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **Use Structured Outputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always use Pydantic models\n",
    "- Always use `response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}`\n",
    "- Always validate and handle errors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. **Document Your Criteria**\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep track of:\n",
    "- What each score means (1-5 scale)\n",
    "- Example responses for each score level\n",
    "- When to use which evaluation dimension"

    "### When NOT to Use LLM-as-Judge\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't use judges when:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Objective facts can be tested** → Use assertions\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # ❌ Don't use judge for this\n",
    "   eval = llm_judge(response, \"Does it mention port 443?\")\n",

    "   # ✅ Use assertion instead\n",
    "   assert \"443\" in response\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simple format validation** → Use Pydantic\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # ❌ Don't use judge\n",
    "   eval = llm_judge(json_output, \"Is this valid JSON?\")\n",
    "   \n",
    "   # ✅ Use validation\n",
    "   data = AccountData(**json.loads(json_output))\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tool selection** → Check tool calls directly\n",

    "   eval = llm_judge(response, \"Did agent call correct tool?\")\n",
